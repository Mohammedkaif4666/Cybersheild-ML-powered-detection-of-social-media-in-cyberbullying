# CyberShield: ML-Powered Detection of Social Media Cyberbullying
This project focuses on building an intelligent system that detects cyberbullying on social media platforms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning models. The system is designed with a Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction, allowing users to input text and instantly receive predictions on whether the content is bullying or non-bullying.

The workflow involves data preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization), feature extraction using TF-IDF, and classification using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Performance is evaluated with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to ensure reliability.

By integrating machine learning with a user-friendly interface, the project provides a practical tool to combat online harassment, promoting safer digital interactions.
